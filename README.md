Portfolio Website

This website is my professional protfolio for my work as a Theatre Artist. I use this site as a home for my online resume and portfolio of my design work. It includes basic information about me, an accordian box resume page, and a portfolio of my work in the form of image galleries. It includes a responsive menu featuring animated hamburger animation, transition animations on the portoflio and gallery pages, and uses javascript to enlarge images in the gallery pages. It scores higher than 90 across the the site on PageSpeed Insights.
